# Card Database

The purpose of this script is to create a simple card database that allows the user to enter a number, name, and owned state of a card in a tkinter GUI window. 
There are several methods for general function: search, add to database, update an entry, insert at a specified location, filter by not owned and some debugging methods for renumbering in case of an off by x error. 

The script is simple and the GUI is primitive, but at it's core this allows a user to create a deck or list of any sort and keep track of it in an automated way. I found this useful for large lists (above 200).
This was primarily a training exercise as I've never worked with tkinter, SQLite, or made an interactive Python GUI. 

Potential to update in the future. 

## Note
Tested and packaged as an executable on macOS.
